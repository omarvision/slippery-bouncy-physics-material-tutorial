# slippery-bouncy-physics-material-tutorial
When gameobjects collide what decides the rules of how they interact with each other? Are they slippery like ice, bouncy like a ball, or is it like dragging a block of cement? In Unity, the colliders can have a material assigned to them -  physics materials. The physic materials of these colliders with materials will be visible when they are sliding on a surface of when the physics forces of a rigidbody push gameobjects into eachother.  In this unity tutorial we will see how to setup some physics materials and control a game object with the keyboard, and we will see some game objects just falling and sliding on surfaces.
